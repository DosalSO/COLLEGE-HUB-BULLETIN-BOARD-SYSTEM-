Creating the login and logout functionality for our College Hub Bulletin Board System 
was both a challenging and rewarding experience, as it required me to integrate session
handling, user authentication, and dynamic navigation updatesâ€”all while ensuring security 
and a smooth user interface; through this process, I gained a deeper understanding of PHP sessions,
database interactions using XAMPP, and building a responsive and personalized user experience that 
securely manages access across the platform.
